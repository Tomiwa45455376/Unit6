<h2>WELCOME</h2>
<p>Hot Beans Web was set up in 2010 by Philip Heinz due to his enthusiasm for web advancement. He chose to set up the business after he was unable to find anyplace to make his optimal site so he figured he could improve. We thought of the name Hot Beans Web because of Philip second name "Heinz". In 2013 Philip at long last moved the business from a little office in Chobham to a greater office in Farnborough business park which permitted Philip to grow the business and increment how much clients we have. Presently in 2019 Hot Beans Web works for a few organizations and gives the most ideal experience. We are continuously hoping to develop so look at the employment opportunities to check whether you can join the Hot Beans Web family.</p>
